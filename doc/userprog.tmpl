---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

First stage of the argument passing is done in process_execute when the file
name is being extracted from the whole string and passed on to thread_create.

The second stage takes place in start_process function (which gets executed 
after the thread has been created). The arguments get extracted from the string
one argument at a time using strtok_r and then they get added to a list of 
arguments in the order they are read from the string (i.e. the file name first
and then the rest). Also this list of arguments will store the information
about the stack address(as pointed by eip) where the current argument has been
added. At the same time the arguments are put onto the stack.

The third stage will take care of any padding that might be necessary by 
rounding down the if_.eip to a value that is multiple of four (see the algorithm
in the code used to do that) and also of writing the addresses of the previous
arguments on the stack (i.e. these addresses will be used as pointer addresses).
Finally add the address of the pointer to the argument pointers (i.e. char **)
and the argc (which is the size of the list).

By the way page fault is implemented if the stack gets corrupted or overflows
the thread will be killed (see implementation of kill() in exception.c) and all
of its resources released. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() uses a global variable to store the the current location/pointer
when tokenising the string (the global variable is stored somewhere in the user 
thread). 
This is a bad idea as in the kernel context this value might be overwritten
by other threads that call strtok and thus the tokenising process would fail.
strtok_r() on the other hand uses a local pointer in order to save the progress
which makes the function safe to use.  

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

One of the advantages of doing the argument passing in the shell is that
it allows for some more options when passing arguments (e.g. the user can
get file names as argument easier, by pressing TAB or it can edit the arguments
in an interactive way) and more user freedom by being able to customize the
way arguments are read.

Another advantage is that the tokenisation process is done in the shell and thus
reducing the amount of work that needs to be executed in kernel context (i.e.
the arguments could be passed in the usual way as an array with argc and argv
and in process_execute they could get copied off the stack into a temporary page
and afterwards in start_process they could simply be copied at the top of the
user space with a simple memcpy command. 

Also probably on of the most important aspects of shells is pipelining which 
allows for output from some processes to be passed as input to other processes
(the output can be modified the way the user wants).
